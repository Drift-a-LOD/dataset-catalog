# dataset-catalog

This is a comprehensive list of datasets available on the Web that deal with semantic change and/or concept drift phenomena. The collection is part of a community effort around the [Drift-a-LOD workshops](http://event.cwi.nl/drift-a-lod/2016/).

To add yours, simply fork this repo, modify the list below, and send us a pull request.

- [Dynamic Linked Data Observatory (DyLDO)](http://swse.deri.org/dyldo/data/): a systematic crawl of de-referenceable and timestamped Web data in RDF. Snapshots cover from 2012-05-06 until 2016-03-27.
- [somoclu-dyldo](https://github.com/albertmeronyo/somoclu-dyldo/tree/master/data): a number crunch over a subset of the DyLDO dataset, counting predicate frequency per document and snapshot.
